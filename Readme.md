This is our final year project called Gnosis. 
a)	Gnosis is a one stop solution to enhance the skills of students in an easy and interactive way by giving regular feeds to the students regarding different topics.

b)	It is a web project designed and developed in Laravel framework, PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, JQUERY, SQL. I worked in backend development.

c)	I created a bot in UiPath which scraped feeds from different sources online regarding different topics like machine learning, Block Chain and more.

d)	Whenever feeds are updated, users get a push notification and goal was to make users subconsciously learn things.

e)	I created an android app which is basically a WebView of website with custom android notifications.
